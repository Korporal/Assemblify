By having an assembly attribute we can simplify several things. 

For example we can (in VS) provide a project RC -> Assemblify -> Publish as well as a project RC -> Assemblify -> Publish To.

The 'Publish' will leverage the default folder specified in the assembly info, in fact we could disable this option if the attribute is absent.
